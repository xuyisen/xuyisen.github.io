excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose an automatic approach, namely Phof, which predicts whether a higher-order function will be called in the future. Higher- order functions that are most likely to be called should be tested first. Our approach can assist developers to reduce the number of higher- order functions under test. In Phof, we extracted 24 features from source code and logs to train a predictive model based on known higher-order functions calls. We empirically evaluated our approach on 2854 higher-order functions from six real-world Scala projects. Experimental results show that Phof based on the random forest algorithm and the SMOTE strategy performs well in the prediction of calls of higher-order functions. Our work can be used to support the scheduling of limited test resources.'
